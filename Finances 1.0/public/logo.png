<!-- IMPORTANT: You need to add a logo.png file to the public directory -->
<!-- This should be a small icon file (32x32 or 64x64 pixels) representing your financial tracker app -->
<!-- For now, you can use any small icon or create a simple one -->
<!-- The file path should be exactly: /public/logo.png -->
